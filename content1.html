                    <article class="about-detial">Environmental protection is a way for people to protect the earth's natural habitat from encroachment by individuals, organizations or governments. People can repair and improve the damage to natural resources and the environment by protecting or changing the current trend of the environment.</article>
                    <article class="about-detial">However, due to continued population growth and overconsumption, especially today's technological pressures, the biophysical environment has become frequently and permanently degraded. Many of the world's environmental organizations have also begun to restrict these activities that lead to environmental degradation. At the same time, pollution levels of air, water, plastics and other natural resources are on the rise, requiring more effective environmental policies in all countries.</article>
                    <article class="about-detial">Not only that, but another term for environmental protection can also be described as the prevention and protection of unnecessary but present changes in natural ecosystems caused by human actions. The awareness of environmental protection includes stopping the over-exploitation of natural resources, reducing all kinds of pollution and so on. In particular, one of the ways to improve People's Daily awareness of environmental protection is to take measures conducive to environmental protection, such as the three R's waste grade.</article>

This logic can easily be understood as if there is less waste, then less will be recycled or reused. Therefore, "reduce" means to minimize the amount of waste people produce and throw away.</acticle>

When people find that there are useless or damaged items, we can choose to keep them in case we find other uses for them in the future. In fact, whether it is finding bargains in old furniture or getting repairable items in picking up, people can reuse these items. However, learning to reuse items or repurpose them in different ways in the intended way are all vital behaviors in waste management.</article>

Recycling an item means that it will be converted into raw material again and shaped into a new item instead of throwing it away. However, there are very few materials on earth that cannot be recycled. Therefore, people should understand which products can be recycled or not. Through this careful selection of recyclable product opportunities, this can also be the first step towards efficient recycling.</article>
